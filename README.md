**Learn how to use the best and most practical computer vision algorithms using OpenCV**

## What is this book about?
An arena that has been positively impacted by the advancements in processing power and performance is the field of Computer Vision. It's only natural that over time, more and more algorithms are introduced to perform Computer Vision tasks more efficiently. Hands-On Algorithms for Computer Vision is a starting point for anyone who is interested in the field of Computer Vision and wants to explore the most practical algorithms used by professional Computer Vision developers. The book starts with the basics and builds up over the course of the chapters with hands-on examples for each algorithm.

This book covers the following exciting features:
Get to grips with machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms 
Read, write, and process images and videos 
Perform mathematical, matrix, and other types of image data operations 
Create and use histograms from back-projection images 
Detect motion, extract foregrounds, and track objects.  
Extract key points with a collection of feature detector algorithms 
Develop cascade classifiers and use them, and train and test classifiers 
Employ TensorFlow Object Detection to detect multiple objects.

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.
Chapter01 does not contain any code files

The code will look like the following:
```
HistCompMethods method = HISTCMP_CORREL;
double result = compareHist(histogram1, histogram2, method);
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
Hands-On Algorithms for Computer Vision helps those who want to learn algorithms in Computer Vision to create and customize their applications. This book will also help existing Computer Vision developers customize their applications. A basic understanding of computer vision and programming experience is needed.
